# INV-0006 — products-never-branch-on-provider-names

> **observed** — a recovered candidate, not a ratified invariant. Only the owner
> ratifies or rejects it, via `transition-invariant`.

**Intent:** Product code requests AI work by profile or capability through `AiExecutionGateway` and never branches on a provider or model name.

**Why:** [[adrs/ADR-0007-route-ai-work-through-aiexecutiongateway-profiles]].

**Recovery confidence:** **contract** — low confidence. A name grep is a proxy: it flags literal provider names, not every branch on a configured value. Expect to refine the pattern at ratification.

**Check:** [[invariants/checks/products-never-branch-on-provider-names]] — run 2026-10-02; `last_result: pass`.
