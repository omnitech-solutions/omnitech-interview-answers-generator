# INV-0003 — schema-files-and-migrations-agree

> **observed** — a recovered candidate, not a ratified invariant. Only the owner
> ratifies or rejects it, via `transition-invariant`.

**Intent:** Schema files and the single Drizzle migration stream agree: a fresh database reaches the current schema, a second migration run changes nothing, and every declared table, column, foreign key and policy exists after migration.

**Why:** [[adrs/ADR-0005-isolate-tenants-in-one-postgresql-cluster-with-own]].

**Recovery confidence:** **shape** — high confidence. Stated in [[research/concepts/interview-domain-model]] ("Invariants", item 3) and enforced by existing migrate and schema-drift tests.

**Check:** [[invariants/checks/schema-files-and-migrations-agree]] — run 2026-10-02; `last_result: pass`.
